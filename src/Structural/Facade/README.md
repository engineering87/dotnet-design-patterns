# Facade Design Pattern

The Facade Design Pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It aims to make a system easier to use by hiding its complexities behind a unified interface.

## Key Concepts of the Facade Pattern

1. Facade:
Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It acts as a wrapper that hides the complexities of the subsystem by exposing a high-level interface for clients.
Implements a unified interface that delegates client requests to the appropriate subsystem components. The facade encapsulates the interactions between multiple components and simplifies the client's interaction with the subsystem.

2. Subsystems:
Represent the complex components or classes within the subsystem that the facade interacts with. These components perform the actual work but may have complex interfaces and interactions.
Consists of multiple classes or modules that handle specific functionalities. The facade coordinates these components to provide a higher-level operation to the client.

## Code Explanation

* **Subsystems**:
`FileReader`: Handles the reading of files. Contains methods to simulate reading from a file.
`FileWriter`: Handles writing to files. Contains methods to simulate writing to a file.
`FileValidator`: Validates files before operations. Contains methods to simulate file validation.

* **Facade**:
Class `FileManagerFacade` provides a simplified interface for interacting with the file management subsystem. It encapsulates the complex interactions between `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, and `FileValidator`.
Contains a method `ProcessFile` that performs file validation, reads the file, and writes new content, all using the subsystem components.

## Usage

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create a facade instance
        var fileManager = new FileManagerFacade();
        
        // Use the facade to process a file
        fileManager.ProcessFile("path/to/file.txt", "New content");
    }
}
```

# Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern
The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler in the chain either processes the request or passes it to the next handler in the chain. This pattern is useful for scenarios where multiple objects might handle a request, but the specific handler isn't known beforehand.

## Key Concepts of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern
1. Handler:
Definition: An abstract class or interface that declares a method for handling requests and a reference to the next handler in the chain.
Purpose: Defines a common interface for all concrete handlers and establishes the link to the next handler in the chain.

2. Concrete Handler:
Definition: Implements the Handler interface and provides the actual processing logic for the request. Each concrete handler handles specific types of requests or parts of the request.
Purpose: Contains the logic to handle a request if applicable; otherwise, it passes the request to the next handler in the chain.

3. Context:
Definition: The data or information that is passed through the chain of handlers. This is often represented as a request object that contains details necessary for processing.
Purpose: Provides the data that handlers use to process the request and make decisions.

4. Chain:
Definition: The sequence of handlers connected in a specific order. Each handler processes the request and either handles it or passes it to the next handler in the chain.
Purpose: Provides a structured flow through which requests are passed and processed.

5. Decoupling:
Definition: The pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receivers, allowing for flexible and dynamic request handling.
Purpose: Reduces dependencies between the client and the concrete handlers, allowing for changes in the chain structure without affecting client code.

6. Flexibility:
Definition: The pattern allows for the dynamic configuration of the chain of handlers at runtime.
Purpose: Enables the modification of the chain (e.g., adding, removing, or reordering handlers) without altering existing code.

7. Single Responsibility:
Definition: Each handler in the chain is responsible for a specific type of processing or decision-making.
Purpose: Ensures that each handler focuses on a single responsibility, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

8. Responsibility Delegation:
Definition: The pattern allows for the delegation of request handling to appropriate handlers based on the request type or conditions.
Purpose: Distributes the handling of requests among multiple handlers, ensuring that each request is processed in a manner suited to its needs.

## Code Explanation
* **Abstract Handler**:
Definition: `FileOperationHandler` defines an interface for handling requests and maintaining a reference to the next handler in the chain.
Purpose: Provides the base class for concrete handlers and sets up the chain of responsibility.

* **Concrete Handlers**:
    - LoggingHandler: 
        - Purpose: Logs file operations.
        - `HandleRequest` Method: Logs the operation and then passes the request to the next handler.
    - AuthorizationHandler:
        - Purpose: Checks if the operation is authorized.
        - `HandleRequest` Method: Checks if authorization is granted; if not, it denies the operation or passes it to the next handler.
    - ValidationHandler:
        - Purpose: Validates the file operation.
        - `HandleRequest` Method: Validates the operation and then passes the request to the next handler.

* **Setting Up the Chain**:
`SetNext` Method: Used to link handlers in the desired order. For instance, the logging handler is followed by the authorization handler, which is then followed by the validation handler.

## Usage
```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create handlers
        var loggingHandler = new LoggingHandler();
        var authorizationHandler = new AuthorizationHandler();
        var validationHandler = new ValidationHandler();

        // Set up the chain of responsibility
        loggingHandler.SetNext(authorizationHandler);
        authorizationHandler.SetNext(validationHandler);

        // Client requests
        Console.WriteLine("Processing 'read' operation:");
        loggingHandler.HandleRequest("read", "document.txt");

        Console.WriteLine("\nProcessing 'delete' operation:");
        loggingHandler.HandleRequest("delete", "document.txt");
    }
}
```

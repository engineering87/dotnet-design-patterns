# Structural Design Patterns
Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns focused on how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures. These patterns help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn’t need to be modified. They aim to make the components of a system work together more effectively and efficiently. Here are the key concepts common to structural design patterns:

## Key Concepts of Structural Design Patterns
1. Composition over Inheritance:
	- **Purpose**: Encourages the use of object composition rather than inheritance to achieve flexibility and reuse.
	- **Benefit**: Promotes a design where objects are composed of other objects, which allows for more dynamic and flexible system structures compared to rigid inheritance hierarchies.

2. Interfaces and Abstraction:
	- **Purpose**: Provides a way to define and use interfaces and abstract classes to achieve a level of abstraction and decoupling.
	- **Benefit**: Allows different parts of a system to interact through common interfaces, which enhances modularity and reduces dependencies.

3. Decoupling:
	- **Purpose**: Reduces the dependency between components, making them more independent and interchangeable.
	- **Benefit**: Enhances system flexibility and maintainability by allowing components to be modified or replaced without affecting other parts of the system.

4. Flexibility:
	- **Purpose**: Provides mechanisms to change the behavior or structure of a system at runtime or compile-time.
	- **Benefit**: Allows systems to adapt to new requirements or changes in requirements without significant changes to the existing code.

5. Reusability:
	- **Purpose**: Enables the reuse of existing components and designs in different contexts or applications.
	- **Benefit**: Reduces redundancy and development time by leveraging existing solutions for new problems.

## When to Use Structural Patterns
- When you need to compose objects into larger structures without creating tight coupling.
- When you want to add or extend the functionality of objects without modifying their structure.
- When you need to simplify complex or cumbersome interfaces for easier use.
- When your system involves complex class hierarchies and you want to manage them more efficiently.
- When you want to reuse code and functionality in a flexible, maintainable way.
- When you need to support multiple implementations of an interface and keep them interchangeable.

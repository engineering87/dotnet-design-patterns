# Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral design patterns focus on the interaction between objects and the way responsibilities are distributed among them. These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They help in designing systems that are flexible, maintainable, and scalable by defining how objects communicate and collaborate to achieve specific behaviors.

## Key Concepts of Behavioral Design Patterns
1. Encapsulation of Behavior:
	- **Purpose**: Encapsulates complex behavior within objects to simplify the interface and manage how operations are executed. This separation of concerns allows for more modular and maintainable code.
	- **Implementation**: Encapsulates operations or behavior in classes, providing a clear interface for interacting with the behavior while hiding the implementation details.

2. Responsibility Delegation:
	- **Purpose**: Distributes responsibilities among objects to ensure that no single object becomes overly complex or handles too many tasks. This delegation supports the Single Responsibility Principle and enhances code readability.
	- **Implementation**: Uses patterns that define how objects should collaborate and pass responsibilities to other objects. This allows for dynamic changes in behavior and promotes flexibility.

3. Behavioral Patterns:
	- **Purpose**: Defines common communication patterns between objects and how objects interact to accomplish specific tasks. Behavioral patterns focus on how objects collaborate and the sequence of interactions.
	- **Implementation**: Provides solutions to common problems in object communication, such as how to execute operations, handle events, or manage state changes.

4. Flexible Object Interaction:
	- **Purpose**: Allows objects to interact with each other in a flexible and extensible manner. This flexibility makes it easier to adapt to changing requirements and extend functionality.
	- **Implementation**: Uses patterns that enable objects to communicate and collaborate without being tightly coupled, facilitating easier changes and extensions.

## When to Use Behavioral Patterns
- When the interaction between objects needs to be flexible and decoupled.
- When you need to define a communication protocol between objects in a systematic way.
- When the logic is complex and you want to distribute responsibilities across different classes.
- When you want to encapsulate varying behavior to make it easily interchangeable or extendable.

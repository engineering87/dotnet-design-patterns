This repository showcases .NET C# Design Patterns. The patterns can be browsed by their high-level descriptions or by looking at their source code. Each design pattern category has its own formal description and each pattern is represented with concrete examples in order to prove the effectiveness of their use.

## What Are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are **standardized solutions** to common problems encountered in Software Design. They provide reusable templates for solving recurring design issues in a way that promotes best practices and improves the overall architecture of a Software System. Design patterns are not code snippets but rather general concepts that can be adapted to specific needs. They help in creating systems that are **modular**, **maintainable**, and **scalable** by defining best practices for structuring code and handling various aspects of software design.

## GoF Design Patterns
The **GoF (Gang of Four)** design patterns refer to a collection of 23 design patterns that were introduced in the book **"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"** published in 1994 by four authors: *Erich Gamma*, *Richard Helm*, *Ralph Johnson*, and *John Vlissides*. This book became a cornerstone in the field of software engineering and introduced the concept of design patterns as a systematic approach to solving common design problems.

## Categories of Design Patterns
Design patterns are typically categorized into three main types based on their role and purpose:

1. **Creational Patterns**
2. **Structural Patterns**
3. **Behavioral Patterns**

### Creational Patterns
Creational patterns focus on the process of object creation. They deal with how objects are instantiated, which can be a complex process depending on the requirements. These patterns abstract the instantiation process, allowing for more flexible and reusable code.

### Structural Patterns
Structural patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures. They help in defining how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures while ensuring flexibility and efficiency.

### Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns focus on the interactions between objects and how responsibilities are distributed among them. They define how objects communicate and collaborate to perform specific tasks.

## Importance of Design Patterns
By leveraging design patterns, developers can create more robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems. Patterns provide a framework for solving common design problems and ensure that solutions adhere to best practices in software engineering.

1. **Reusability**:
Design patterns provide tested and proven solutions that can be reused across different projects. This reduces the need to reinvent the wheel and helps in creating consistent and reliable solutions.

2. **Maintainability**:
Patterns promote code organization and modularity, making it easier to maintain and update software. By following established patterns, changes to one part of the system can be made with minimal impact on other parts.

3. **Scalability**:
Design patterns help in building scalable systems by promoting best practices and providing guidelines for expanding functionality. They make it easier to add new features or components without disrupting existing code.

4. **Communication**:
Design patterns provide a common vocabulary for developers to discuss and understand solutions to design problems. They facilitate clear communication and collaboration within development teams.

5. **Flexibility**:
Patterns offer ways to handle changing requirements and evolving designs by decoupling components and defining clear responsibilities. This flexibility allows systems to adapt to new needs or technologies more easily.

## Why Use Design Patterns?
Design patterns act as a toolbox of proven solutions, helping developers create better, more efficient, and maintainable software. They offer a structured approach to problem-solving, improve code readability, and facilitate collaboration among team members.

## Patterns vs. Anti-patterns
Design patterns and anti-patterns in programming are like two sides of the same coin. Design patterns address certain recurring problems faced by the programmers. Over the years, these patterns have been improved and are effective in the development of software that is manageable, flexible, and efficient. These patterns represent standard operating procedures that save the developers time and direct them to produce orderly, predictable, and sound code.
Conversely, anti-patterns are flawed strategies that may appear to be reasonably good resolutions but tend to backfire big time in the long run. Derived from fallacies, inexperience, or an overzealous desire to seek instant gratification, these anti-patterns are often the result of the implementation of practices that make sense at the time but create problems and added stress down the line. It is imperative that the developers are able to locate and define these types of behavior since they may render the system hard to maintain, enhance, or even be understood.
Particular anti-patterns present themselves in the context of certain conditions, i.e. stress to deliver rendering sub-optimal architectural designs being made or lack of effective interaction/interrelation comprehension among team members. Such conditions may lead to the spread of substandard designs causing extensive bugs in the codebase and making new code integration very hard.

## Repository Layout
Each design pattern category has its own directory and each pattern inside has its own folder, its description and its source code.
